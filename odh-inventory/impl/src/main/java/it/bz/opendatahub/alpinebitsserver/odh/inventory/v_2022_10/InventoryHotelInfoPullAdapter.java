/**
 * This middleware removes elements and attributes that are not allowed in AlpineBits 2022-10
 * Inventory/HotelInfo action.
 * <p>
 * ODH as persisting backend saves AlpineBits inventory data for different AlpineBits versions.
 * Those versions may allow elements and attributes that are not allowed in AlpineBits 2022-10.
 * Therefor it is necessary to adapt the response data for AlpineBits 2022-10 before it is returned.
 * Otherwise, the XML validation may fail.
 * <p>
 * An example for the problem described is the definition of the <code>ContactInfos</code> element,
 * that changed between AlpineBits 2017-10 and 2020-10 versions: in 2017-10, the <code>ContactInfos</code>
 * element was allowed to contain all elements and attributes defined in OTA-2015A. In AlpineBits 2020-10
 * the usage was restricted to a subset of the allowed elements.
 * <p>
 * Please note, that this middleware only removes data to establish compatibility with AlpineBits 2022-10.
 * It does not provide missing data, because that is not possible most of the time. For example, if some
 * required element or attribute is missing (because that is allowed in a different AlpineBits version),
 * there is no way to build the missing data.
